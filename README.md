# RotatingMenu

## Description
The RotatingMenu project is a simple webpage that enhances its aesthetic appeal by incorporating a rotating menu feature. The webpage contains an article, providing a visually appealing structure. In the top-left corner, a hamburger menu icon. Clicking this icon rotates the entire page, revealing a navigation menu with options (Home, About, Contact) at the bottom-left. The menu icon transforms into an 'X', and clicking it restores the page to its original state.
